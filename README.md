# Alarm-Clock
This project develops a Smart Alarm Management System allowing users to set, view, edit, delete, snooze, and trigger multiple alarms efficiently. It uses linked lists, queues, and arrays for fast management, ensures persistence via file handling, and provides timely notifications through messages or sounds.
